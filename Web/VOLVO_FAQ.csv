Question,Answer
What kind of cars does Volvo offer and how quickly can I get one?,"Volvo offers a range of models, trims and engines to suit your lifestyle, from SUVs to saloons, all with advanced features. By selecting a ready-to-deliver vehicle you can get your car in 1 calendar month. Alternatively you can customise your own car from the factory, which typically means a longer delivery time than on a ready-to-deliver car."
Are all of Volvo's available cars new?,We have a wide range of new cars available through different finance and purchase options. We also offer approved used cars to buy online or at a retailer via Volvo Selekt. (link?: https://www.volvocars.com/uk/l/used-cars/)
